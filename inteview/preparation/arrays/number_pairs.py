'''

Given two arrays X and Y of positive integers, find number of pairs such that xy > yx
(raised to power of) where x is an element from X and y is an element from Y.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
Each test consists of three lines. The first line of each test case consists of two space separated M and N
denoting size of arrays X and Y respectively. The second line of each test case contains M space separated integers denoting
the elements of array X. The third line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting elements of array Y.
