 Complexities of algorthims

 constant time comlexities algoritm O(1): used when you want swap two numbers
 Logarithmic time comlexities or binary search (O(logN)) : used to search for something in a sorted array
 Linear time comlexities O(N)  : find max element in as unsorted array you have to iterate in all the items one by one
 lineararithmic  time comlexities O(N*logN) most of divide and conquere algorithim:
 linearithimic time complexities O(N*logN) : eg Heapsort,Quicksort,Mergesort
 Quadratic O(N^2) time complexities: Bubble sort,
 Exponetial O(2^N) time complexities : travel salesman problem with dynamic programming
 Factorial O(N!) : Travelling saleman with brute force search

 P - polinomial (is a class of ci=omputational problmns that can be solved efficiently ) :
 sort array,search, finsd the shortest route all problems are in polynomial

 NP complete : p==NP  chinese postman problem, graph coloring
 NP-hard:
 NP : Non - deterministic polynomial  eg factorization , travel salesman
